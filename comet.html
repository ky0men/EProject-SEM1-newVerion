          A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing
          close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process
          that is called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or
          coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the
          effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the
          nucleus of the comet...

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet" class="text-title">A comet</a>
                is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing
                close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process
                that is called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or
                coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the
                effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the
                nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters
                to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections
                of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15
                times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one
                astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen
                from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc
                of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and
                recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions.
                Comets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits, and they
                have a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years
                to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets
                originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc,
                which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are
                thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy
                bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the
                nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun
                from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by
                passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass
                once through the inner Solar System before being flung to
                interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an
                apparition. Comets are distinguished from asteroids by the
                presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere
                surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts
                termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the
                nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of
                dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or
                outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have
                passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their
                volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids.
                Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets,
                having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer
                Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur
                minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and
                comets. In the early 21st century, the discovery of some minor
                bodies with long-period comet orbits, but characteristics of inner
                solar system asteroids, were called Manx comets. They are still
                classified as comets, such as C/2014 S3 (PANSTARRS). 27 Manx
                comets were found from 2013 to 2017. As of April 2021 there are
                4595 known comets, a number that is steadily increasing as more
                are discovered. However, this represents only a tiny fraction of
                the total potential comet population, as the reservoir of
                comet-like bodies in the outer Solar System (in the Oort cloud) is
                estimated to be one trillion. Roughly one comet per year is
                visible to the naked eye, though many of those are faint and
                unspectacular. Particularly bright examples are called "great
                comets". Comets have been visited by unmanned probes such as the
                European Space Agency's Rosetta, which became the first to land a
                robotic spacecraft on a comet, and NASA's Deep Impact, which
                blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior.
